foundational smart farm project developed during my freshman year at university. Built around an ESP32 microcontroller, it integrates a DHT22 for temperature and humidity, soil moisture sensors, and an OLED displayâ€”combined with the Blynk IoT platform for real-time monitoring and control of environmental conditions.
